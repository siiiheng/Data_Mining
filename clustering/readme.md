# Implement the Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm to cluster the data
In BFR, there are three sets of points:

Discard set (DS), Compression set (CS), Retained set (RS)

For each cluster in the DS and CS, the cluster is summarized by:

N: The number of points

SUM: the sum of the coordinates of the points 

SUMSQ: the sum of squares of coordinates
